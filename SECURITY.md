## Reporting a Vulnerability

We appreciate responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. If you discover a potential security issue in this project:

1. **Do NOT open a public GitHub issue.** Public disclosure could put users at risk before a fix is available.
2. **Email us directly** at **[security@yourdomain.org]** (replace with a dedicated security contact email).
3. **Provide detailed information** in your report, including:
    * A clear description of the vulnerability.
    * Steps to reproduce the issue (code snippets, configurations, or sequences of requests are helpful).
    * The potential impact if the vulnerability is exploited.
    * Any suggested mitigation or fix, if you have one.

We aim to acknowledge receipt of your report within **72 hours**. We will investigate the issue and communicate with you regarding the triage status, potential timelines for a fix, and coordinate disclosure if necessary.

We may recognize your contribution publicly once the vulnerability is addressed, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Security Practices

* We strive to follow secure coding practices.
* Dependencies are periodically reviewed (consider adding automated checks like Dependabot).
* Container images are built from trusted base images.

Thank you for helping keep the AI Scraping Defense Stack secure!
